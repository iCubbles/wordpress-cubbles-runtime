#cubbles-runtime

This is a small Wordpress plugin which adds Cubbles to your wordpress page. Basically it does 3 things right now:
1. Add webcomponents-lite.js from cubbles.world sandbox store
2. Add cubbles clien runtime extension (CRE) from cubbles.world sandbox store
3. Adjust allowedposttags to enable admin user to use custom tags in post html editor

#Restrictions

Currently the plugin is still under development and does only support the CRE version 1.8.0-SNAPSHOT from https://cubbles.world/sandbox store.
Also only the custom tag `<travel-planner>` is supported (see https://github.com/iCubbles/demo.travel-planner).
